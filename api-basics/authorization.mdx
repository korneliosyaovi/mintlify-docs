Ulipa uses API keys in HTTP Authorization headers to authenticate requests. This ensures that only authorized applications can access and manage payment data.

To make a request, include the `api-key` header:

```json Example
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://path/to/example/endpoint' \
     --header 'api-key: {{YOUR_API_KEY}}' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "sample_parameter": "sample_value"
}
'
```

The required API key depends on the type of operation you're performing.

## Types of API keys
Ulipa provides three types of API keys, each serving a specific security function:

1. **Public key** – Used for initiating transactions and other client-side requests.
2. **Private key** – Required for sensitive operations like verifying orders. Keep this key secure and use it only on the server side.
3. **Encryption key** – Helps encrypt highly sensitive data for added security.

### Public Key
This key is used in most API requests, including transaction initiations. It is designed for client-side operations or less sensitive actions.

```json Example
PGW-PUBLICKEY-TEST-887bxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxEC77xxxx
```

### Private Key
Private keys are used for more sensitive operations such as verifying a customer's order. You should keep this key confidential and only use it in secure server-side environments.

<Warning>
  Never expose this key in client-side code or commit this to version control systems e.g. git.
</Warning>

```json Example
PGW-SECRETKEY-TEST-887bxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxEC77xxxx
```

### Encryption Key
This key enables encryption which is used to mask highly sensitive data within requests, adding an extra layer of security. It is important for protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and other confidential data.
